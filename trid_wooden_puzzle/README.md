 "Gaya" wooden puzzle number 521, at a company far-far away, we gave it a couple of time as a programming task at coding interviews. some interviewees were scared, so we've solved it ourselves, here's my take in the 1h timeframe we were giving for the task.
 
 The puzzle is a "Carpet puzzle"

This was being asked as an "Interview Question" (given 1 hour and a computer with any environment preinstalled) in a galaxy far far away, in an office with this physical Gaya toy on the waiting desk for interviees.

The solution here is what I came up with in 1hour (40 min?) of C(++) code.
